                  <h4>Statutes</h4>
                  <p>Statutes are the laws of the state.</p>
                  <p>All statutes originate as bills that are enacted by the legislature and either signed by the governor or allowed to take effect without the governor's signature.</p>
               </div>

               <div class="col col-sm-6">
                  <h4>Bills</h4>
                  <p>Bills are the legislative documents used to create or amend laws.</p>
                  <p>Bills should be read in the context of statutes. Understanding how the existing law is affected by a bill is fundamental to accurate reading and understanding of the bill.</p>
                  <p style="text: smaller">For this reason, this guide discusses statutes first.</p>

            <h4>How Statutes Are Organized</h4>
            <p>Current Texas statutes can be found in at least one of three collections.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><h6><em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em></h6></li>
                  <div><p style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible text]</p>
                     <p>A 1925 revision organized Texas statutes into a unified body of law. Each statute was titled and assigned a sequential article number that corresponded with its alphabetized title. This organization was published in a series of volumes known as <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>.</p>
                     <p>Subsequent additions to the law were incorporated into the 1925 organization. To maintain the integrity of the statutes' numerical and alphabetical arrangement, the publisher often added letters to the end of article designations for new laws relating to the same subject matter. Eventually the reference system became confusing.</p>
                  </div>
               <li><h6>Topical codes</h6></li>
                  <div><p style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible text]</p>
                     <p>In 1963 the legislature charged the Texas Legislative Council with conducting an ongoing nonsubstantive revision of the 1925 statutes. Under the revision program, the statutes are arranged into topical codes and numbered using a system that accommodates future expansion of the law. Repealed, invalid, and duplicative provisions are eliminated.</p>
                     <p>Most Texas statutes today are found in the resulting 27 codes. The few 1925 statutes that have not been incorporated into a code may still be found in <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>.</p>
                     <p style="color:#cee79e;">[Bookshelf graphic showing the codes]</p>
                  </div>
               <li><h6>Session laws</h6></li>
                  <div><p style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible text]</p>
                     <p>Session laws are the compilation of the laws enacted during a particular legislative session. Bills that become effective following each legislative session are assigned a session law chapter number by the secretary of state. The number corresponds with the order in which the enacted bill is filed with the secretary of state and is often used to identify a specific bill from a specific session: for example, <a href="http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/sessionLaws/74-0/HB_1125_CH_981.pdf">Chapter 981 (H.B. 1125), Acts of the 74th Legislature, Regular Session, 1995</a>. Bills from each legislative session are compiled in order of chapter number and published as the <em>General and Special Laws</em>for that session.</em></p>
                     <p>Most bills amend the topical codes or <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>. Some bills, however, enact new law without reference to a civil statute or code section. These bills can be found in the session laws and are usually incorporated later into the civil statutes or into a code, as appropriate.</p>

            <h4>Internal Organization</h4>

            <p>Most codes are organized using a standard scheme, which is based on sections. Gaps in chapter and section numbering usually exist for future expansion.</p>

            <h3>Tips for Reading and Understanding a Statute</h3>
            <p>Many statutes are straightforward and easily understood. Others are more complicated because cross-references, dependent subdivisions, and exceptions to a statute's application can make the meaning difficult to follow. Here are a few tips.</p>

               <h4>Read the complete heading.</h4>
               <p>The heading establishes how the section fits into the organization of the entire code. <br><span style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible example]</span></p>

               <div class="row justify-content-center">
                  <div class="col-sm-10">
                     <div class="card" id="statute-heading">
                        <div class="card-body">
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">LOCAL GOVERNMENT CODE</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">TITLE 8.  ACQUISITION, SALE, OR LEASE OF PROPERTY</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">SUBTITLE B.  COUNTY ACQUISITION, SALE, OR LEASE OF PROPERTY</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">CHAPTER 262.  PURCHASING AND CONTRACTING AUTHORITY OF COUNTIES</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">SUBCHAPTER C.  COMPETITIVE BIDDING IN GENERAL</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center"><mark>Sec. 262.023.  COMPETITIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES</mark></h4>
                        <div class="card-text text-ex"></div>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>

               <h4>Check for the context of the statute.</h4>
               <p>Think of the statute as a unit of law that is part of a series of units of law and scan the table of contents to see what sections precede and follow the section you are reading. If there is a short title section (usually at the beginning of the chapter or subchapter), read it.</p>

               <h4>Check for a definitions section.</h4>
               <p>A definition may be used in the statutes to avoid repetition of a long term - for example, to indicate that "department" in a particular section refers to the Department of State Health Services. Make sure you understand references to general terms like "department," "agency," or "executive director."</p>
               <p>If present, a definitions section is usually found at the beginning of a chapter or subchapter.<br><span style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible example]</span> <span style="color: #a2c363;">[Collapsible - more info]</span></p>

            <p>Exceptions are signaled by keywords such as "certain," "only," "under," "over," "more than," "less than," "if," and "unless". A series connected by "and" or "or" often indicates whether all or only one of the elements of the series are needed to satisfy conditions set by the statute.</p>

            <h4>Do not skip over words that you do not know or fully understand.</h4>
            <p>Do not rely only on common understanding for the meaning of a word about which you are unsure, and do not assume that a word <strong>(e.g., "person")</strong> has the same meaning that it has in everyday conversation. Use statutory context and definitions to determine its precise meaning.

            <h4>Read through cross-referenced sections in their entirety.</h4>
            <p>Legislative drafters avoid repetition of text by cross-referencing other statutory provisions. If a cross-reference is to an entire chapter or subchapter, at least read through that chapter's or subchapter's table of contents and definitions section to understand the context.</p>

            <h2>Bills</h2>

               <p>The <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.30">Texas Constitution</a> makes the bill the exclusive means by which the legislature may enact, amend, or repeal a statute.</p>
               <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>No law shall be passed, except by bill.</p>
                  <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>Article III, Section 30, Texas Constitution</cite></footer>
               </blockquote>

               <p>The <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.35">Constitution</a> also prescribes the one-subject rule:
               <blockquote class="blockquote">
                  <p>No bill, (except general appropriation bills ...) shall contain more than one subject.</p>
                  <footer class="blockquote-footer"><cite>Article III, Section 35, Texas Constitution</cite></footer>
               </blockquote>
               <p>The reasons for the one-subject rule are to ensure that a legislative proposal stands on its own merits and is not combined with unrelated proposals, to prevent unrelated provisions from being added to a bill without being fully vetted, and to keep individual bills from becoming overly complex or massive.</p>
               <p>A bill containing more than one subject is subject to a point of order, and a law enacted in violation of the one-subject rule is subject to attack in court. However, the rule does not prohibit <strong>omnibus bills</strong> if every provision relates to a single subject.

            <h3>How Bills Are Structured</h3>

            <h4>General Organization</h4>

            <h5>Sections and Articles</h5>
            <p>Most bills are organized into sections. In bill section headers, the word SECTION is spelled out in full in all capital letters, followed by the appropriate number.

            <h3>Parts of a Bill</h3>

            <h4>Introductory Language</h4>
            <p>The standard features of a bill include the heading, the caption, and the enacting clause, which are referred to collectively as introductory language. Here is an example.
               <br><span style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible example - scrollspy?]</span></p>

            <h5>Heading</h5>
            <p>The first line at the top of the first page of every bill is the heading, sometimes referred to as the <strong>byline</strong>. The heading indicates the author's name, the chamber in which the bill was introduced (H.B. for a house bill and S.B. for a senate bill), and the bill number.</p>


            <h5>Caption</h5>
            <p>Below the heading is the caption (also known as the <strong>title</strong>), which is required by <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.35">Section 35, Article III, Texas Constitution</a>, to be included in every bill. Since the caption gives legislators and other readers an immediate explanation of the bill's subject matter, it is the most important part of the introductory language. The caption usually includes the phrase "relating to".

               <div class="row justify-content-center">
                  <div class="col-sm-10">
                     <div class="card border-success">
                        <div class="card-body text-success">
                           <div class="card-text">
                              <p>For a further discussion of the title or caption, see Section 3.03 of the <a href="http://www.tlc.texas.gov/docs/legref/draftingmanual.pdf"><em>Texas Legislative Council Drafting Manual</em></a>.</p>

                  </div>
               </div>

            <h5>Enacting Clause</h5>
            <p><a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.29">Section 29, Article III</a>, Texas Constitution, requires every bill to include an enacting clause in the exact language shown in the example. The enacting clause is in all capital letters and ends with a colon.</p>

            <h4>Substantive Provisions</h4>
            <p>Since the bill is the vehicle for enactment of law, most of the provisions in a bill add, amend, or delete statutory provisions. Following the bill's introductory language are the substantive provisions as discussed in the earlier section <a href="#statute-parts">Parts of a Statute</a>: <a href="#statute-st">short title</a>, <a href="#statute-intent">statement of policy or purpose</a>, <a href="#statute-defs">definitions</a>, <a href="#statute-op-provs">principal operative provisions</a>, and <a href="#statute-enf-provs">enforcement provisions</a>.</p>
            <p>Some of a bill's substantive provisions, however, do not amend a code or statute section. This section adds further information on those situations.</p>

            <h5>Short Title</h5>
            <p>Some short titles are not introduced as an amendment to a particular statute, but are found only in the bill. Here is an example from <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/SB00572F.HTM">S.B. 572, 81st Legislature</a>.
               <br><span style="color:#cee79e;">[Collapsible example]</span></p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
               <div class="col-sm-10">
                  <div class="card" id="short-title">
                     <div class="card-body">
                        <div class="card-text text-ex">
                           <p>SECTION 1. This Act shall be known as Jacob's Law.</p>

                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>

            <h5>Statement of Policy or Purpose</h5>
            <p>A statement of policy or purpose may be included when a substantial body of new law is introduced or when the operative provisions of a short bill do not clearly indicate what the bill is intended to accomplish. Like some short titles, some statements of policy or purpose are found only in the bill. Here is an example from <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/83R/billtext/html/SB01026F.htm">S.B. 1026, 83rd Legislature</a>.

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
               <div class="col-sm-10">
                  <div class="card" id="leg-intent">
                     <div class="card-body">

                           <p>SECTION 4.01. LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE. This Act is enacted under Section 43, Article III, Texas Constitution. This Act is intended as a codification only, and no substantive change in the law is intended by this Act. This Act does not increase or decrease the territory of any special district of the state as those boundaries exist on the effective date of this Act.</p>

                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>

            <h5>Repealers</h5>
            <p>Another way bills can amend the law is by repealing existing provisions. A repealer is a clause that cites the portion of law to be repealed. Most repealers are found near the end of a bill or bill article and may appear as a bill subsection or an entire bill section. Be cautious - these provisions can make substantive changes.

            <h4>Procedural Provisions</h4>
            <p>There are several types of procedural provisions. Some, which are of temporary significance only, are not incorporated into the codes or revised statutes but do appear in the session laws.</p>

            <h5>Severability Provisions</h5>
            <p>There are two types of severability provisions: <strong>severability</strong> clauses and <strong>nonseverability</strong> clauses. Their purpose is to resolve the question of whether, when part of a statute is held to be invalid, the remainder of the statute is invalid.</p>
            <p>Although severability clauses still occasionally appear in Texas bills, there is no practical need for them since Sections <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.311.htm#311.032">311.032</a> and <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.312.htm#312.013">312.013</a>, Government Code, provide that all statutes are severable unless specifically declared otherwise.
               <br><span style="color:#cee79e">[Collapsible example]</span></p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
               <div class="col-sm-10">
                  <div class="card" id="severability">
                     <div class="card-body">
                        <div class="card-text text-ex" style="text-indent:2rem;">
                           <p>SECTION 3. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable.</p>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>

            <p>Nonseverability clauses make clear that parts of a statute are meant to be treated together and to rise and fall together under a constitutionality challenge. There are general nonseverability clauses, which apply to all of the provisions of an act, and special nonseverability clauses, which apply to specific provisions.

            <h5>Saving Provisions</h5>
            <p>A saving provision "saves" from the application of a law certain conduct or legal relationships that occurred before or existed on the effective date of the law. One of the most common saving provisions applies to criminal or civil offenses.

            <h5>Transition Provisions</h5>
            <p>A transition provision provides for the orderly implementation of legislation to avoid the confusion that can result from an abrupt change in the law. A common type of transition provision provides instruction for the transfer of powers and duties from one agency to another. Another directs an agency to adopt rules or procedures required by a general substantive provision.
               <br>Both types can be found in this example.<span style="color:#cee79e;"> [Collapsible example]</span> <span style="color:#a2c363;"> [Collapsible more info]</span></p>

            <h3>Reading and Understanding a Bill</h3>
            <p>Scanning the substantive provisions of a bill for certain features can help you learn valuable information quickly. Here are some tips on what to look for.</p>

            <h4>Check to see if the bill is adding new language, amending existing language, or both.</h4>
            <p>Look for underlined or bracketed language with strike-throughs. (In the session laws, new language is indicated by <em>italics</em> rather than underlining.) Simply noticing the amount and placement of underlined or italicized text and bracketed text will give you an idea of the bill's complexity.
            <br><span style="color:#cee79e;">[Link examples?]</span></p>

            <h4>Look for definitions.</h4>
            <p>Definitions can help determine the scope of a bill and provide clues about its focus. What agencies or entities are involved? Is the bill directed at a particular group?</p>

            <h4>Scan the recital for each bill section.</h4>
            <p>Is the bill adding or amending just one section or article of the statutes? Is it adding or amending a subsection? Is it adding an entire subchapter or chapter? Is it making a series of similar changes to sections in different codes or different chapters of one code?</p>

            <h4>Look for conforming changes.</h4>
            <p>Often a bill makes a single substantive change to the law that makes related changes necessary in other sections of law. These related changes, known as <strong>conforming</strong> changes, are often easy to spot because they involve multiple insertions or deletions of the same words or phrases. For example, if the name of an agency is changed, every reference to the agency throughout the codes must be changed to conform to the new name.</p>
            <p>Identify such changes and move on. Don't spend time examining every instance of a revision that is not substantively changing the statute.</p>

            <h4>Check for repealers.</h4>
            <p>Read the provisions that the bill repeals. Do the repealers represent conforming or substantive changes? Is the bill replacing one chapter or subchapter with another?</p>

            <h4>Refer to the surrounding sections of the statute to put the bill or bill section in context.</h4>
            <p>Understanding the context of the change to law made by the bill is essential to understanding the change.

            <p>The change illustrated by this bill is fairly simple. The <strong>caption</strong> establishes that the bill relates to who is considered a peace officer in Texas law. The <strong>amended statute</strong> is a list of persons considered peace officers, and the <strong>underlining</strong> and <strong>bracketing</strong> should immediately indicate that persons are being added to the list.</p>
            <p>In essence, the bill amends the Code of Criminal Procedure to include among peace officers the fire marshal and any related officers, inspectors, or investigators appropriately commissioned by a county.</p>

                           <p class="indent1">BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 1. Chapter 105, Alcoholic Beverage Code, is amended by adding Section 105.052 to read as follows:</p>
                           <p class="added" style="text-indent:2rem;">Sec. 105.052. SALE OF BEER BY DISTRIBUTOR’S LICENSEE IN CERTAIN METROPOLITAN AREAS. In addition to the hours specified for the sale of beer in Section 105.05(b), the holder of a general, local, or branch distributor’s license whose premises is located in a county with a population of 1.8 million or more or in a county adjacent to a county with a population of 1.8 million or more may sell, offer for sale, or deliver beer beginning at 4 a.m. on any day except Sunday.</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this Act takes effect September 1, 2007.</p>

               </div>
            </div>

            <p>First, scan the caption and the section heading to Section 105.052, Alcoholic Beverage Code. The <strong>caption</strong> tells you that the bill will affect the hours for the wholesale delivery or sale of beer in certain counties. You may infer from this that the bill will either extend or reduce the hours during which wholesale delivery or sale of beer can occur. Note the use of the word <strong>"certain"</strong> in the caption and the <strong>section heading</strong>. This is a key word alerting you to the fact that the bill will not affect all counties, and those counties affected will be defined or described in the bill.</p>
            <p>Now note that the <strong>added statutory language</strong> begins with "[i]n addition to the hours . . . ." Clearly the bill is adding to the hours during which wholesale delivery or sale of beer can occur.</p>
            <p>Also note that the new hours are in addition to the hours specified in <strong>Section 105.05(b)</strong>, Alcoholic Beverage Code. When you read for comprehension, you should read that section to obtain the context for the changes made by the bill.</p>

On Sunday he may sell beer between midnight and 1:00 a.m. and between noon and midnight, except that permittees or licensees authorized to sell for on-premise consumption may sell beer between 10:00 a.m. and noon if the beer is served to a customer during the service of food to the customer.</p>

               </div>
            </div>

            <p>In summary, the bill amends the Alcoholic Beverage Code to authorize the holder of a general, local, or branch distributor's license whose premises is located in a county with a population of at least 1.8 million or in a county adjacent to such a county to sell or deliver beer beginning at 4 a.m. on any day except Sunday. This is in addition to any other period during which the sale or delivery of beer is authorized.</p>

                           <p>relating to the payment of damages awarded against members of local governments, including directors of soil and water conservation districts.</p>
                           <p class="indent1">BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 1. Section 102.001, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is amended to read as follows:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">Sec. 102.001. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">(1) “Employee” includes an officer, volunteer, or employee, a former officer, volunteer, or employee, and the estate of an officer, volunteer, or employee or former officer, volunteer, or employee of a local government. <span class="added">The term includes a member of a governing board.</span> The term does not include a county extension agent.</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">(2) “Local government” means a county, city, town, special purpose district, <span class="added">including a soil and water conservation district,</span> and any other political subdivision of the state.</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 2. The amendment by this Act of Section 102.001, Civil Practice and Remedies Code, is intended to clarify rather than change the existing law.</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 3. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this Act takes effect September 1, 2007.</p>

            </div>

            <p>The <strong>caption</strong> explains that the bill relates to the payment of damages awarded against certain members of local governments.</p>
            <p>Notice that the bill achieves its purpose by amending the <strong>definitions</strong> section of <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/htm/CP.102.htm">Chapter 102</a>, Civil Practice and Remedies Code. To fully understand the bill, you need to scan the chapter. What are the damages to which the bill refers? What is the subject matter of Chapter 102? You should look up that chapter and, at the very least, read through the subchapter and section headings to understand the context of the bill.</p>
            <p>Note that the bill is not actually making a change in the law. The <strong>statement of intent</strong> in SECTION 2 makes that clear. This is a rare example. The bill's single purpose is to clarify the law.</p>
            <p>The bill clarifies that the authority of a local government to pay actual damages awarded against one of its employees and to provide legal counsel in a suit for such damages may be exercised by a soil and water conservation district on behalf of a member of the district's governing board.</p>
