            <h3>Reading Statutes and Bills</h3>

            <p><a href="www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN3.htm#3.1">Section 1, Article III, Texas Constitution</a>, vests the legislative power of Texas in a Senate and House of Representatives. Statutes are the laws of a state as enacted by the legislature and approved by, or allowed to take effect without the signature of, the governor. Bills,the legislative documents used to create or amend laws, are read in the context of existing statutes. Understanding existing law and how it is affected by a bill is fundamental to reading
            and understanding a bill. With a basic understanding of how to read the statutes, you will be better prepared to read and understand a bill.</p>

            <h3>Statutes</h3>

            <p>Each bill passed by the legislature and not vetoed by the governor becomes effective according to the terms outlined in the bill or general effective date provisions in the state constitution. Once effective, the text of the bill becomes law. Such law can be found in the session laws and in <em>Vernon’s Texas Civil Statutes</em> or the 27 codes that are organized by topic.</p>

                  <h6>Codes</h6>
                  <p>Most Texas statutes today are arranged into 27 topical codes (see box at left), which are the result of many decades of legislative enactment and revision of law. In 1963, the legislature charged the Texas Legislative Council with conducting an ongoing nonsubstantive revision of the 1925 statutes. Under the revision program, the statutes are arranged into topical codes and numbered using a system that accommodates future expansion of the law. In addition, the revision eliminates repealed, invalid, and duplicative provisions. The few 1925 statutes
                          that have not been incorporated into a code may be found in <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>.</p>

                  <h6><em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em></h6>

                  <p>Before the codification, Texas revised its statutes four times: 1879, 1895, 1911, and 1925. The 1925 revision organized the statutes into a unified body of law. Each statute was titled and assigned a sequential article number that corresponded with its alphabetized title. This organization was published and bound in black volumes known as <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>.
                          Subsequent additions to the law were incorporated into the organization established in 1925. To maintain the integrity of the statutes' numerical and alphabetical organization, the publisher often added letters to the</p>

            <h4>How Codes and Statutes Are Organized</h4>
            <p>Current Texas statutes can be found in at least one of three collections.</p>
            <ul>
               <li><h6><em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em></h6></li>

                     <p>A 1925 revision organized Texas statutes into a unified body of law. Each statute was titled and assigned a sequential article number that corresponded with its alphabetized title. This organization was published in a series of volumes known as <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>.</p>
                     <p>Subsequent additions to the law were incorporated into the 1925 organization. To maintain the integrity of the statutes' numerical and alphabetical arrangement, the publisher often added letters to the end of article designations for new laws relating to the same subject matter. Eventually the reference system became confusing.</p>

                  <div><p style="color:blue;">[Collapsible text]</p>
                     <p>Session laws are the compilation of the laws enacted during a particular legislative session. Bills that become effective following each legislative session are assigned a session law chapter number by the secretary of state. The number corresponds with the order in which the enacted bill is filed with the secretary of state and is often used to identify a specific bill from a specific session: for example, <a href="http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/sessionLaws/74-0/HB_1125_CH_981.pdf">Chapter 981 (H.B. 1125), Acts of the 74th Legislature, Regular Session, 1995</a>. Bills from each legislative session are compiled in order of chapter number and published as the <em>General and Special Laws</em>for that session.</em></p>
                     <p>Most bills amend the topical codes or <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em>. Some bills, however, enact new law without reference to a civil statute or code section. These bills can be found in the session laws and are usually incorporated later into the civil statutes or into a code, as appropriate.</p>

            <p>The above two organizational schemes include the cumulative body of law up to a point in time. In contrast, session laws are the compilation of the laws enacted during a particular legislative session. Bills that are passed during each legislative session and not vetoed by the governor are assigned a session law chapter number by the secretary of state that corresponds with the order in which the enacted bill is filed with the secretary of state.
                      This chapter designation is often used to identify a specific bill from a specific session, such as <a href="http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/sessionLaws/74-0/HB_1125_CH_981.pdf">Chapter 981 (H.B. 1125), Acts of the 74th Legislature, Regular Session, 1995</a>.

            <p>Most bills amend the codes or civil statutes. Some bills, however, enact new law without reference to a <em>Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes</em> or code section. These bills can be found in the
                      session laws for that session and are usually incorporated into the civil statutes or a code, as appropriate, at a later time.</p>

            <h3>Parts of a Statute</h3>
            <p>Statutory provisions vary in their internal structure and may include a short title, a statement of policy or purpose, definitions, principal operative provisions, and enforcement provisions.
              Some of these provisions will be discussed in the context of learning to read a statute, but some provisions merit further explanation here.</p>
               <h4>Short Title</h4>
               <p>A short title is neither required nor appropriate for most statutory provisions but sometimes is included to provide a convenient way of citing a major, cohesive body of law that deals comprehensively with a subject. The following is an example from the Agriculture Code.</p>

               <p>A statement of policy or purpose is neither required nor appropriate for most statutory provisions but may be included when a substantial body of new law is enacted. The following is an example from the Health and Safety Code.</p>

         <div class="row justify-content-center">
            <div class="col-sm-10">

               <h4>Definitions</h4>
               <p>A statute may include an entire section dedicated to definitions of terms that apply to a code, a title, a chapter, or a subchapter, or it may define terms in a statutory subsection that apply only to that statutory section.</p>

               <h4>Principal Operative Provisions</h4>
               <p>There are two categories of principal operative provisions. Administrative provisions relate to the creation, organization, powers, and procedures of the governmental units that enforce the law. Substantive provisions grant or impose on a class of persons rights, duties, powers, and privileges and may govern conduct by establishing either a mandate or a prohibition.</p>

               <h4>Enforcement Provisions</h4>
               <p>An enforcement provision prescribes a punishment for violating a mandate or a prohibition. Such a provision generally establishes a criminal penalty, a civil penalty, an administrative penalty, injunctive relief, or civil liability as a consequence of violating the mandate or prohibition.</p>

            <h3>Tips for Reading and Understanding a Statute</h3>
            <p>Many statutes are straightforward and easily understood, while others are more complicated. Cross-references, dependent subdivisions, and phrases that provide exceptions to an application of the statute can make the meaning difficult to follow.</p>

            <p>Below are a few tips to help understand statutes.</p>

               <h4>Read the complete heading.</h4>
               <p>The heading (code/title/subtitle/chapter/subchapter/section) establishes how the section fits into the entire code's organization.</p>

               <div class="row justify-content-center">
                  <div class="col-sm-10">
                     <div class="card" id="statute-heading">

                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">SUBTITLE B.  COUNTY ACQUISITION, SALE, OR LEASE OF PROPERTY</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">CHAPTER 262.  PURCHASING AND CONTRACTING AUTHORITY OF COUNTIES</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">SUBCHAPTER C.  COMPETITIVE BIDDING IN GENERAL</h4>
                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">Sec. 262.023.  COMPETITIVE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN PURCHASES</h4>

                  </div>
               </div>

               <h4>Check for the context of the statute.</h4>
               <p>Think of the statute as a unit of law that is part of a series of units of law and scan the table of contents to see what sections precede and follow the section you are reading. If there is a short title section (usually at the beginning of the chapter or subchapter), read it.</p>

            <h2>Bills</h2>
            <p><a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.30">Section 30, Article III, Texas Constitution</a> provides that "[n]o law shall be passed, except by bill." As a result, the bill is the exclusive means by which the legislature may enact, amend, or repeal a statute. Among other requirements, <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.35">Section 35</a> of that same article prescribes the one-subject rule: "No bill, (except general appropriation bills ...) shall contain more than one subject." The policy behind the one-subject rule is that a legislative proposal should stand on its own merits and not be combined with unrelated proposals to generate broader support, to prevent unrelated provisions from being added to the bill without being fully vetted, and to keep individual bills from becoming overly complex or massive. A bill containing more than one subject is subject to a point of order. A law enacted in violation of the one-subject rule is also subject to attack in court. However, this rule does not prohibit "omnibus" bills <!--this term might be better defined with a popup--> if every provision relates to a single subject.</p>

            <h4>Basic Conventions</h4>

            <h5>Amendable Unit</h5>
            <p><a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.36">Section 36, Article III, Texas Constitution</a>, prohibits the "blind amendment" of law &#45; meaning a bill that amends law without fully revealing what is being changed. For example, a bill cannot read <em>Section 42.004, Education Code, is amended by deleting "in accordance with the rules of the State Board of Education."</em> As a result of this prohibition, a bill must include an amendable unit, i.e., the text of a law being amended in sufficient length to indicate the purpose of the change and express a complete thought. In Texas, the threshold for an amendable unit is a complete sentence.</p>

            <h5>Format Conventions</h5>
            <p>Bills can amend the codes and statutes by adding new language or changing or deleting existing language. Provisions that directly amend an existing statute must follow two format conventions. First, the language describing the statute being amended, also called the recital, must refer to the official citation of that statute.</p>

            <div class="row justify-content-center">
               <div class="col-sm-10">

                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>

            <p>Second, rules of the senate and house of representatives have traditionally required new language to be underlined and deleted language to be stricken through and bracketed so the reader can compare the current version of the law with the proposed version. The use of brackets is similar to the use of quotations. If there is an opening bracket, there must be a closing bracket. If multiple paragraphs are bracketed, there should be an opening bracket at each indentation, but not at the end or beginning of each line.</p>

            <h5>Heading</h5>
            <p>The first line at the top of the first page of every bill is the heading, sometimes referred to as the "byline". The heading indicates the author's name, the chamber in which the bill was introduced (H.B. for a house bill and S.B. for a senate bill), and the bill number.</p>

The caption is meant to give legislators and other persons a convenient way to determine the subject of the bill. For purposes of understanding the bill, the caption is the most important part of the introductory language because it serves as an immediate explanation of the bill's subject matter. The caption usually includes the phrase "relating to" as shown below.</p>

            <p>Since the bill is the vehicle for enactment of law, most of the provisions in a bill add, amend, or delete statutory provisions. Following the bill's introductory language are the substantive provisions as discussed in this publication's section on Parts of a Statute: short title, statement of policy or purpose, definitions, principal operative provisions, and enforcement provisions.

            <p>Since the bill is the vehicle for enactment of law, most of the provisions in a bill add, amend, or delete statutory provisions.

            <h5>Short Title</h5>
            <p>A short title is neither required nor appropriate for most bills but sometimes is included in a bill to provide a convenient way of citing a major, cohesive body of law that deals comprehensively with a subject. Some short titles are not introduced as an amendment to a particular statute and, therefore, are found only in the bill, like the following example from <a href="http://www.legis.state.tx.us/tlodocs/81R/billtext/html/SB00572F.HTM">S.B. 572, 81st Legislature</a>:</p>

               </div>
            </div>

            <h5>Statement of Policy or Purpose</h5>
            <p>A statement of policy or purpose is neither required nor appropriate for most bills but may be included when a substantial body of new law is introduced or when the operative provisions of a short bill do not clearly indicate what the bill is intended to accomplish. Some statements of policy or purpose are not introduced as an amendment to a statute and, therefore, are found only in the bill, like the following example from <a href="https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/83R/billtext/html/SB01026F.htm">S.B. 1026, 83rd Legislature</a>:</p>

                           <p>SECTION 4.01. LEGISLATIVE INTENT OF NO SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE. This Act is enacted under Section 43, Article III, Texas Constitution. This Act is intended as a codification only, and no substantive change in the law is intended by this Act. This Act does not increase or decrease the territory of any special district of the state as those boundaries exist on the effective date of this Act.</p>

            </div>

            <h5>Repealers</h5>
            <p>Bills also can amend the law by repealing existing provisions. Repealers (see below) work by citing the portion of law to be repealed and may appear as an entire bill section or as a subsection within a bill section. Most repealers are found among the last sections of a bill or bill article. Be cautious as these provisions can make substantive changes.</p>

            <h5>Statement of Policy or Purpose</h5>
            <p>A statement of policy or purpose may be included when a substantial body of new law is introduced or when the operative provisions of a short bill do not clearly indicate what the bill is intended to accomplish. Like some short titles, some statements of policy or purpose are found only in the bill.

            <p>Another way bills can amend the law is by repealing existing provisions. A repealer is a clause that cites the portion of law to be repealed. Most repealers are found near the end of a bill or bill article and may appear as a bill subsection or an entire bill section. Be cautious - these provisions can make substantive changes.

            <h5>Severability Provisions</h5>
            <p>There are two types of severability provisions: severability clauses and nonseverability clauses. They have been used in bills to resolve the question of whether, when part of a statute is held to be invalid, the remainder of the statute is invalid. There is no practical need for severability clauses since Sections <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.311.htm#311.032">311.032</a> and <a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/GV/htm/GV.312.htm#312.013">312.013</a>, Government Code, provide that all statutes are severable unless specifically declared otherwise. However, severability clauses still occasionally appear in bills.</p>

               <div class="col-sm-10">

                           <p>SECTION 3. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are declared to be severable.</p>

            </div>

            <p>Nonseverability clauses are used to make it clear that parts of a statute are meant to be treated together and rise and fall together under a constitutionality challenge. There are general nonseverability clauses, which declare that none of the provisions of an act are severable, and special nonseverability clauses, which declare that specific provisions are not severable.</p>

Section 1 of this Act, prohibiting the manufacture of widgets without a license, and Section 2 of this Act, imposing a tax on the manufacture of widgets, are not severable, and neither section would have been enacted without the other. If either provision is held invalid, both provisions are invalid.</p>

            <h5>Saving Provisions</h5>
            <p>A saving provision "saves" from the application of a law certain conduct or legal relationships that occurred before or existed on the effective date of the law. The most common saving provision applies to criminal or civil offenses, as shown below.</p>

            <h5>Transition Provisions</h5>
            <p>A transition provision provides for the orderly implementation of legislation to avoid the confusion that can result from an abrupt change in the law. A common type of transition provision provides instruction for the transfer of powers and duties from one agency to another; another common type directs an agency to adopt rules or procedures required by a general substantive provision. Both can be found in the following example:</p>

            <h4>Procedural Provisions</h4>
            <p>There are several types of procedural provisions. Some, which are of temporary significance only, are not incorporated into the codes or revised statutes but do appear in the session laws.</p>

            <h5>Severability Provisions</h5>
            <p>There are two types of severability provisions: <strong>severability</strong> clauses and <strong>nonseverability</strong> clauses. Their purpose is to resolve the question of whether, when part of a statute is held to be invalid, the remainder of the statute is invalid.</p>

            <p><a href="http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3.htm#3.39">Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution</a>, provides that a law, other than the general appropriations act, may not take effect "until ninety days after the adjournment of the session at which it was enacted" unless the legislature provides for an earlier effective date by a vote of two-thirds of the membership.
               There are standard types of effective date provisions: immediate effect, a specific effective date before the 91st day, a specific effective date after the 91st day, an effective date contingent on an event or expiration of a period of time, and an effective date contingent on passage of another bill or constitutional amendment.

            <h3>Tips for Reading and Understanding a Bill</h3>
            <p>Scanning the substantive provisions of a bill for certain features can help you learn valuable information quickly, in much the same way that reading the caption informs you about a bill's general subject matter.</p>

            <h4>Check to see if the bill is adding new language, amending existing language, or both.</h4>
            <p>To do this, look for underlined or bracketed language with strike-throughs. If you are reading the session laws, new language is indicated by <em>italics</em> rather than underlining.</p>
            <p>Without even reading for comprehension, simply noticing the amount and placement of underlined or italicized text and bracketed text will give you an idea of the bill's complexity.</p>

            <h4>Look for definitions.</h4>
            <p>Definitions can help determine the scope of a bill and provide clues about its focus. What agencies or entities are involved? Is the bill directed at a particular group?</p>

            <h4>Scan the recital for each bill section.</h4>
            <p>Is the bill adding or amending just one section or article of the statutes? Is it adding or amending a subsection? Is it adding an entire subchapter or chapter? Is it making a series of similar changes to sections in different codes or different chapters of one code?</p>

            <h4>Look for conforming changes.</h4>
            <p>Many times a bill makes a single substantive change to the law that necessitates related changes to be made in other sections of law. These changes are known as conforming changes. Identify such changes and move on; don't spend time trying to understand a change if it is not substantively changing the statute. These changes are often easy to spot because they involve multiple insertions or deletions of the same words or phrases. For example, if the name of an agency is changed, every reference to the agency throughout the codes must be changed to conform to the new name.</p>

            <h4>Check for repealers.</h4>
            <p>Read the provisions that the bill repeals. How many repealers are there? Is the bill replacing one chapter or subchapter with another?</p>

            <h4>Refer to the surrounding sections of the statute to put the bill or bill section in context.</h4>
            <p>Understanding the context of the change to law made by the bill is essential to understanding the change.
            From an initial reading of the example below, the fee information in Subsection (b) of Sec. 214.194, Local Government Code, appears transparent. The alarm system permit fee charged by a municipality may not be more than $50 per year.</p>

            <h3>Reading and Understanding a Bill</h3>
            <p>Scanning the substantive provisions of a bill for certain features can help you learn valuable information quickly. Here are some tips on what to look for.</p>

            <h4>Check to see if the bill is adding new language, amending existing language, or both.</h4>
            <p>Look for underlined or bracketed language with strike-throughs. (In the session laws, new language is indicated by <em>italics</em> rather than underlining.) Simply noticing the amount and placement of underlined or italicized text and bracketed text will give you an idea of the bill's complexity.
            <br><span style="color:blue;">[Link examples?]</span></p>

            <h4>Look for definitions.</h4>
            <p>Definitions can help determine the scope of a bill and provide clues about its focus. What agencies or entities are involved? Is the bill directed at a particular group?</p>

            <h4>Scan the recital for each bill section.</h4>
            <p>Is the bill adding or amending just one section or article of the statutes? Is it adding or amending a subsection? Is it adding an entire subchapter or chapter? Is it making a series of similar changes to sections in different codes or different chapters of one code?</p>

            <h4>Look for conforming changes.</h4>
            <p>Often a bill makes a single substantive change to the law that makes related changes necessary in other sections of law. These related changes, known as <strong>conforming</strong> changes, are often easy to spot because they involve multiple insertions or deletions of the same words or phrases. For example, if the name of an agency is changed, every reference to the agency throughout the codes must be changed to conform to the new name.</p>
            <p>Identify such changes and move on. Don't spend time examining every instance of a revision that is not substantively changing the statute.</p>

            <h4>Check for repealers.</h4>
            <p>Read the provisions that the bill repeals. Do the repealers represent conforming or substantive changes? Is the bill replacing one chapter or subchapter with another?</p>

            <h4>Refer to the surrounding sections of the statute to put the bill or bill section in context.</h4>
            <p>Understanding the context of the change to law made by the bill is essential to understanding the change.

            <h2>Practice Exercises</h2>
            <p>This section provides three bills that have been considered by the Texas Legislature, showing examples of underlining and bracketing and discussing points that must be considered when reading and understanding the bills.</p>

            <h3>Exercise 1</h3>

                           <h4 class="card-title title-ex text-center">AN ACT</h4>
                           <p>relating to the designation of certain fire marshals and related officers, inspectors, and investigators as peace officers.</p>
                           <p class="indent1">BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 1. Article 2.12, Code of Criminal Procedure, is amended to read as follows:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">Art. 2.12. WHO ARE PEACE OFFICERS. The following are peace officers:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">(1) sheriffs, their deputies, and those reserve deputies who hold a permanent peace officer license issued under Chapter 1701, Occupations Code;</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">...</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">(34) officers commissioned by the State Board of Dental Examiners under Section 254.013, Occupations Code, subject to the limitations imposed by that section; [<span class="deleted">and</span>]</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">(35) investigators commissioned by the Texas Juvenile Probation Commission as officers under Section 141.055, Human Resources Code<span class="added">; and</span></p>
                           <p class="added" style="text-indent:4rem;">(36) the fire marshal and any related officers, inspectors, or investigators commissioned by a county under Subchapter B, Chapter 352, Local Government Code.</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 2. This Act takes effect immediately if it receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, as provided by Section 39, Article III, Texas Constitution. If this Act does not receive the vote necessary for immediate effect, this Act takes effect September 1, 2009.</p>
                        </div>
                     </div>
                  </div>
               </div>
            </div>

            <p>The change illustrated above is fairly simple. The caption establishes that the bill relates to who is considered a peace officer in Texas law. The amended statute is a list of persons considered peace officers, and the underlining and bracketing should immediately indicate that persons are being added to the list.</p>
            <p>In essence, the bill amends the Code of Criminal Procedure to include among peace officers the fire marshal and any related officers, inspectors, or investigators appropriately commissioned by a county.</p>

                           <p>relating to the designation of certain fire marshals and related officers, inspectors, and investigators as peace officers.</p>

                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">Art. 2.12. WHO ARE PEACE OFFICERS. The following are peace officers:</p>
                           <p style="text-indent:4rem;">(1) sheriffs, their deputies, and those reserve deputies who hold a permanent peace officer license issued under Chapter 1701, Occupations Code;</p>

            <p>The change illustrated by this bill is fairly simple. The <strong>caption</strong> establishes that the bill relates to who is considered a peace officer in Texas law. The <strong>amended statute</strong> is a list of persons considered peace officers, and the <strong>underlining</strong> and <strong>bracketing</strong> should immediately indicate that persons are being added to the list.</p>
            <p>In essence, the bill amends the Code of Criminal Procedure to include among peace officers the fire marshal and any related officers, inspectors, or investigators appropriately commissioned by a county.</p>

                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">SECTION 1. Chapter 105, Alcoholic Beverage Code, is amended by adding Section 105.052 to read as follows:</p>
                           <p class="added" style="text-indent:2rem;">Sec. 105.052. SALE OF BEER BY DISTRIBUTOR’S LICENSEE IN CERTAIN METROPOLITAN AREAS. In addition to the hours specified for the sale of beer in Section 105.05(b), the holder of a general, local, or branch distributor’s license whose premises is located in a county with a population of 1.8 million or more or in a county adjacent to a county with a population of 1.8 million or more may sell, offer for sale, or deliver beer beginning at 4 a.m. on any day except Sunday.</p>

            <p>First, scan the caption and the section heading to Section 105.052, Alcoholic Beverage Code. The caption tells you that the bill will affect the hours for the wholesale delivery or sale of beer in certain counties. You may infer from this that the bill will either extend or reduce the hours during which wholesale delivery or sale of beer can occur. Note the use of the word "certain" in the caption and the section heading. This is a key word alerting you to the fact that the bill will not affect all counties, and those counties affected will be defined or described in the bill.</p>
            <p>Now note that the added statutory language begins with "[i]n addition to the hours . . . ." Clearly the bill is adding to the hours during which wholesale delivery or sale of beer can occur.</p>
            <p>Also note that the new hours are in addition to the hours specified in Section 105.05(b), Alcoholic Beverage Code. When you read for comprehension, you should read that section to obtain the context for the changes made by the bill.</p>

                           <p style="text-indent:2rem;">Sec. 102.001. DEFINITIONS. In this chapter:</p>

            <p>Two aspects of the bill should stand out immediately. First, the caption explains that the bill relates to the payment of damages awarded against certain members of local governments. Notice that the bill achieves its purpose by amending the definitions section of Chapter 102, Civil Practice and Remedies Code. To fully understand the bill, you need to scan the chapter. What are the damages to which the bill refers? What is the subject matter of Chapter 102? You should look up that chapter and, at the very least, read through the subchapter and section headings to understand the context of the bill.</p>
            <p>Second, note that the bill is not actually making a change in the law. The statement of intent in SECTION 2 makes that clear. This is a rare example. The bill's single purpose is to clarify the law.</p>
            <p>The bill clarifies that the authority of a local government to pay actual damages awarded against one of its employees and to provide legal counsel in a suit for such damages may be exercised by a soil and water conservation district on behalf of a member of the district's governing board.</p>
